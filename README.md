# Start page

This is a simple start page for my personal use. Feel free to fork and create your own version.

This one features some simple links, top hacker news stories, weather, and some other tidbits. 

It is a very basic rails 7 app - didn't even use postgres on this one - but I don't foresee it holding a lot of information and tracking lots of things.
