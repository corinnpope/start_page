# Start page

This is a simple start page for my personal use. Feel free to fork and create your own version. You'll need:
* your own openweather API key
* change your zip in `get_weather` method in static_controller.rb
* change your sign in static_controller.rb for the horoscope
* make sure you have the right time zone in application.rb

This one features some simple links, top hacker news stories, weather, and some other tidbits.
